This page describes the binary, `build/mojo-dllm`. The `./mojo-dllm run` launcher
takes the prompt as its first word, accepts `-m` for `--model`, defaults
`--device` to `auto` and passes the other flags on to the binary; see the
[Quick start](quickstart.md).

`mojo-dllm COMMAND --help` (or `-h`) prints that command's usage and exits 0.
Help wins over every other problem in the arguments, wherever it appears, except
as the value of a flag (`--prompt --help` sets the prompt to `--help`).
`mojo-dllm`, `mojo-dllm help` and `mojo-dllm --help` print the usage of every
command. Each command declares its flags: a flag the command does not declare
stops the run (see [Errors](#errors)).

`mojo-dllm --version` prints one line, `mojo-dllm` and the version, and exits
0. The same version is the `"version"` key of `run --json`.

## `run`

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--model PATH` | required | LLaDA or Dream GGUF file |
| `--prompt TEXT` | required | the user message |
| `--max-tokens N` | 128 | tokens to generate (the masked canvas) |
| `--steps N` | `--max-tokens` | denoising steps; a multiple of the block count |
| `--block-length N` | 32, or `--max-tokens` when that is smaller | LLaDA's semi-autoregressive block size; must divide `--max-tokens`. Dream ignores it |
| `--temperature T` | 0 | LLaDA: 0 is greedy; above 0 adds Gumbel noise as LLaDA does. Dream supports only 0 and stops with an error above it |
| `--remasking S` | `low_confidence` | LLaDA: `low_confidence` or `random`. Dream: `entropy` (the default), `maskgit_plus`, `topk_margin` |
| `--threshold P` | 0 (off) | LLaDA: each step also commits every masked token whose confidence is at least P, so easy blocks finish in fewer steps (Fast-dLLM's parallel decoding). A step still commits at least what the schedule says. Not exact: see [Benchmarks](benchmarks.md#steps-and-quality) for its measured effect on accuracy |
| `--dual-cache` | off | LLaDA: cache every position's keys and values and, inside a block, recompute only that block's rows (Fast-dLLM's DualCache). The cache is refreshed at the first step of each block. Not exact: the prompt and later blocks see keys from the block's first step; see [Benchmarks](benchmarks.md#steps-and-quality) for its measured effect on accuracy. Cannot combine with `--full-logits` |
| `--seed N` | 42 | seeds this program's PRNG (it does not reproduce a PyTorch run). It fixes DiffusionGemma's random canvas and draws as well |
| `--eb-steps N` | 48 | DiffusionGemma: most denoising steps (use it instead of `--steps`, which that model refuses) |
| `--eb-t-min T` | 0.4 | DiffusionGemma: the temperature the schedule approaches, 0 or more; the last of `--eb-steps` steps runs at `T + (t-max - T) / steps` |
| `--eb-t-max T` | 0.8 | DiffusionGemma: the temperature of the first step; it falls linearly from there |
| `--eb-bound B` | 0.1 | DiffusionGemma: a position is accepted while the entropies of the lower-entropy positions before it sum to at most B |
| `--eb-stability N` | 1 | DiffusionGemma: steps the argmax canvas must hold before the run may stop; 0 or more, and 0 lets the first step stop it |
| `--eb-confidence C` | 0.005 | DiffusionGemma: the run may stop once the mean entropy over the canvas is below C |
| `--threads N` | all logical CPUs | worker threads (with `--device gpu`, only the sampler uses them) |
| `--device D` | `cpu` | `cpu`, or `gpu` for an NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 8.0 or newer |
| `--no-chat` | off | skip the chat template |
| `--full-logits` | off | LLaDA: compute logits for every position, as a generic runtime would (for benchmarking). Dream ignores it |
| `--no-early-stop` | off | run every step even after the answer is final (the benchmark and parity harnesses use it) |
| `--visual` | off | show the canvas: masked positions as teal blocks, tokens committed in that step in bold orange when colour is enabled |
| `--visual-interval N` | 1 | redraw every N steps and at the final step; requires `--visual` and N at least 1 |
| `--verbose` | off | model, device and load time before the text; step timings and peak memory after it |
| `--dump-step-stats` | off | one line per denoising step |
| `--json` | off | one JSON object with timings, tokens and text. `steps_taken` counts the denoising steps run and `stop_reason` says why the loop ended: `complete`, `answer_fixed` (early stop), or for DiffusionGemma `converged` or `max_steps` |

The printed answer ends at the first end-of-text or end-of-turn token in the
canvas. Generation stops as soon as that answer is final: once the first
position after the prompt that is still masked or holds such a token holds
such a token, no later step can change the printed text, because steps only
fill masked positions. The result is the same text with fewer steps, and
`--json` reports `"stopped_early": true`. `--no-early-stop` runs every step.

The `--eb-*` flags belong to DiffusionGemma and every other model refuses them by name. DiffusionGemma's `--json` reports `"stopped_early": true` when the stop rule ended the run before `--eb-steps` steps.

### Visual output

The final canvas always appears, including when generation stops early between
redraws. Its step number is the last observed step; any remaining masks stay
visible. A final frame that was already drawn is not repeated.

| stdout | `NO_COLOR` | colour codes | clear + home (`ESC[2J ESC[H`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| terminal | unset or empty | yes | yes |
| terminal | non-empty | no | yes |
| not a terminal | any | no | no; frames separated by one blank line |

On a terminal, `--visual` leaves the last canvas frame on screen and does not
print the answer a second time. Without `--visual`, or when stdout is not a
terminal, `run` prints the answer after generation.

Without colour, newly committed tokens have no highlight. Redirected frames
contain no ANSI escapes. With `--visual --json`, frames still go to stdout
before the JSON line; consumers should select the line starting with `{`.

Invalid `--visual-interval` values and use without `--visual` exit with status
1 before model loading. The messages name `--visual-interval`: `must be at
least 1`, `needs --visual`, or `needs an integer`.

## `tokenize`

Prints the token ids of the chat-formatted prompt, the same ids `run` feeds the
model. Useful to compare against `llama-tokenize`. For a `diffusion-gemma` file
the prompt is the file's chat template: `<bos>`, a user turn and an open model
turn, which gives one BOS token (id 2). It reads the tokenizer arrays of the
file and none of its weights, so it runs on a file too big to load.

## `inspect`

Prints GGUF metadata, a count per tensor type, and every tensor's type and
shape. It needs no supported architecture, so it works on any GGUF file. For
`diffusion-gemma` it also prints a `config:` block with what the reader took
from the file (layer kinds, K/V heads and head size per kind, experts, canvas
length), or `config: refused:` and the reason, such as the key that is wrong.

## `logits`

Runs one forward pass over the given token ids and writes f32 logits for the
requested positions to a file, `[positions, vocab]`, row major. The parity
tests use it; see [Correctness](correctness.md).

On a `diffusion-gemma` file the tokens are the prompt followed by the canvas,
whose length the file declares (`diffusion.canvas_length`, 256 in the real
model). The model scores only the canvas, so `--rows` must list exactly those
positions, the last canvas-length ones, and the file holds `[canvas, vocab]`.
It runs on the CPU only; `--device gpu` is refused. Three flags apply to this
architecture alone and are refused on the others:

- `--path unified` (the default) runs the prompt and the canvas in one pass.
  `--path cached` prefills the prompt, keeps its keys and values, and steps the
  canvas against them. The two agree bit for bit.
- `--prev FILE` names the previous denoising step's canvas logits, `[canvas,
  vocab]` f32 as this command writes them, and turns self-conditioning on.
  `--prev-temp-inv X`, which must come with it, is 1 divided by the temperature
  of that previous step (1.25 for the first step's 0.8).

## Errors

An error names the thing that is wrong. Usage errors exit with status 2 and
change nothing; every other error exits with status 1.

| Message | Cause and next step |
|---|---|
| `ERROR: unknown flag --stpes for 'run' (did you mean --steps?)` | The command does not declare the flag. The parenthesis appears when a declared flag is at most 2 edits away. The next line is `see: mojo-dllm run --help` |
| `ERROR: missing required flag --model for 'run'` | A required flag is absent. The usage of the command follows |
| `ERROR: missing model path for 'inspect'` | `inspect` takes the path as an argument. The usage follows |
| `ERROR: unknown command: bogus` | The first argument is not a command. The next line is `see: mojo-dllm --help` |
| `ERROR: unexpected argument 'x' for 'run'` | `run`, `tokenize` and `logits` take flags only, and `inspect` takes one path |
| `ERROR: unknown flag --model=x for 'run'` | Flags take their value as the next argument. The next line says `flags take their value as the next argument: --model x` |
| `ERROR: flag --prompt needs a value` | A value flag is the last argument |
| `ERROR: flag --steps needs an integer, got 'abc'` | A numeric flag holds text, or a number too large for 64 bits. `--temperature` needs a finite number and `--tokens` and `--rows` need comma-separated integers |
| `ERROR: flag --steps must be at least 1, got 0` | `--max-tokens`, `--steps`, `--block-length` and `--threads` need at least 1, and `--temperature` at least 0. The check runs before the model is mapped |
| `ERROR: cannot open model file PATH: No such file or directory` | The path is wrong. The reason is the operating system's. The next line is `to download a model, run: ./mojo-dllm pull` |
| `ERROR: cannot open model file PATH: Permission denied` | The open failed for a reason other than a missing file, such as `Not a directory`. The operating system names the reason. No download hint follows, because `pull` would not fix it |
| `ERROR: is a directory: PATH` | The model path names a directory |
| `ERROR: PATH is not a GGUF file (bad magic).` | A failed download leaves an HTML error page with a `.gguf` name. Delete the file and run `./mojo-dllm pull` again |

The remaining errors exit with status 1 and come from the model file itself:

```text
ERROR: unsupported GGUF tensor type: IQ2_XXS (tensor blk.0.attn_q.weight)
ERROR: tensor blk.0.attn_q.weight is Q8_0: matrix kernels exist for Q4_K and Q6_K
ERROR: unsupported model architecture: qwen2 (runs: llada, dream; read only: diffusion-gemma)
ERROR: required metadata key missing: tokenizer.ggml.model
ERROR: tensor shape mismatch for blk.0.attn_q.weight: [4096, 2048], expected [4096, 4096]
ERROR: no GPU found: the GPU backend needs an NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 8.0 or newer (run with --device cpu)
```

With `--device gpu`, setting `MOJO_DLLM_GPU_PROFILE=1` makes `--verbose` split
a step into GEMM, attention and LM head time. It synchronizes the GPU after
each kernel group to measure them, so leave it off when you benchmark.

## Environment variables

`run` reads a default for ten value flags from the environment. A flag on
the command line wins over its variable, and an empty variable counts as
unset. Boolean flags and `--prompt` have no variable.

| Variable | Flag |
|---|---|
| `MOJO_DLLM_MODEL` | `--model` |
| `MOJO_DLLM_MAX_TOKENS` | `--max-tokens` |
| `MOJO_DLLM_STEPS` | `--steps` |
| `MOJO_DLLM_BLOCK_LENGTH` | `--block-length` |
| `MOJO_DLLM_SEED` | `--seed` |
| `MOJO_DLLM_TEMPERATURE` | `--temperature` |
| `MOJO_DLLM_THREADS` | `--threads` |
| `MOJO_DLLM_DEVICE` | `--device` |
| `MOJO_DLLM_REMASKING` | `--remasking` |
| `MOJO_DLLM_THRESHOLD` | `--threshold` |

With `--verbose`, each value that came from a variable is reported on
stderr. A bad numeric value names its variable in the error. The launcher
command `./mojo-dllm run` always passes `--model` and `--device` to the
binary, so `MOJO_DLLM_MODEL` and `MOJO_DLLM_DEVICE` change nothing there.
Unset these variables before you run `./mojo-dllm setup`,
`scripts/ci-local.sh`, the scripts in `bench/` or `scripts/gpu_profile.py`:
none of them passes `--seed`, `--temperature`, `--remasking` or
`--threshold`, and the checks in `scripts/check_visual.sh` expect fixed
messages, so an exported value would change a result or fail a gate.
