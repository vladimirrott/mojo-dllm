# Quick start

You need Linux on x86-64 with AVX2, glibc 2.34 or newer, about 6 GB of free
memory, and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). uv installs the pinned Mojo
toolchain (Mojo 1.1.0, max-core 26.6.0) into the project's `.venv`; nothing
goes system-wide.

## 1. Set up

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh    # skip if you have uv
git clone https://github.com/vladimirrott/mojo-dllm
cd mojo-dllm
./mojo-dllm setup
```

The uv installer puts `uv` in `~/.local/bin`. If your shell does not find it
afterwards, open a new terminal or run `source ~/.local/bin/env`.

`setup` runs four steps and prints each one:

1. **Toolchain.** It checks the platform, glibc, AVX2 and free memory, stops
   on anything that cannot work, and runs `uv sync --frozen`.
2. **Build.** It compiles `build/mojo-dllm`, or reports that the binary is
   newer than the sources.
3. **Model.** It asks before downloading LLaDA-8B-Instruct Q4_K_M (4.9 GB)
   into the Hugging Face cache, and checks the file's sha256 against the one
   the hub publishes. `--yes` answers the question for you; `--no-model` skips
   the step; `--model` picks another model.
4. **Check.** It generates 16 tokens to prove the binary, the model and the
   device work together.

Without a terminal to ask on (a script, CI), `setup` does not download
anything unless you pass `--yes`. It then exits 3 and prints the command that
finishes the job.

`./mojo-dllm doctor` runs the same checks without changing anything, and adds
the GPU, the binary's age and the model cache. Every line that is not `ok`
names the command that fixes it.

## 2. Generate

```bash
./mojo-dllm run "Explain speculative decoding in two sentences."
./mojo-dllm run "Write a haiku about rain." --max-tokens 64 --steps 32 --verbose
```

The prompt is the first word that is not a flag; quote it. `run` rebuilds the
binary if a source file changed, finds the model, picks the device and hands
the rest of the flags to `build/mojo-dllm run`. [Command line](cli.md) lists
them all.

`--max-tokens` sets the canvas size, `--steps` the number of denoising passes.
Fewer steps run faster and commit more tokens per step, which costs quality.
Each step runs the full model over prompt and canvas, so expect seconds per
step on a laptop CPU. `--verbose` prints load time, per-step time and peak
memory.

The prompt goes through the model's chat template. Pass `--no-chat` to feed
raw text instead.

### The device

`--device auto` is the default. It picks the first NVIDIA GPU with compute
capability 8.0 or newer that `nvidia-smi` lists, and the CPU when there is
none. Status lines go to stderr, so stdout holds only the model's text:

```text
device: gpu (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 6GB Laptop GPU, compute 8.6, 585 MiB free)
```

`auto` does not compare the card's free memory with the model's size. In that
line another program held most of the card, so the run that followed would
have said how much memory it needs and exited. Pass `--device cpu` to run
anyway.

## 3. Other models

`-m` (or `--model`) takes one of three forms:

| Form | Example | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| a file | `-m ~/models/llada.gguf` | used as is |
| the alias | `-m llada-8b` | `mradermacher/LLaDA-8B-Instruct-GGUF`, Q4_K_M (the default) |
| a repo | `-m owner/Some-Model-GGUF:Q8_0` | the file matching that quant, downloaded once |

Without `:QUANT`, a repo resolves to its Q4_K_M file, then Q8_0, then the
first `.gguf` it lists, the order llama.cpp uses. A quant that matches nothing
lists the files the repo has. Split (sharded) GGUF files are not supported.

Tested Q4_K_M checkpoints are LLaDA-8B-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5,
Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Dream-Coder-v0-Instruct-7B and DiffuCoder-7B-cpGRPO.
The added checkpoints were checked on CPU; pass `--device cpu` to reproduce
those runs. See the smoke and [parity evidence](correctness.md) for the exact
files and generation agreement.
Other quantizations still need compatible tensor types. An unsupported
architecture stops with an error naming it.

For DiffuCoder, obtain the file separately under its `apple-amlr` license and
pass its local path with `--model`; it is not bundled with the project.

`./mojo-dllm pull MODEL` downloads without generating. Models live in the
Hugging Face cache (`~/.cache/huggingface/hub`, or `$HF_HUB_CACHE`), shared
with every other tool that uses it. A gated or private repo needs `HF_TOKEN`.

The sha256 check runs on download. A file already in the cache is checked
against the hub's sha256 the first time it is used, and the launcher
remembers the result in `~/.cache/mojo-dllm/verified.json` (under
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` when that is set). A file that fails the check is deleted,
and the next run downloads it again. With `--offline` the check cannot run,
so an unchecked file is used after a warning.

## 4. Offline

```bash
./mojo-dllm pull                      # on a connected machine
./mojo-dllm run "Hello" --offline     # later, with no network
```

`--offline` (or `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`) uses the cache only and fails with the
`pull` command to run when the model is missing.

## 5. Look inside a model

```bash
./mojo-dllm pull                             # prints the model file's path
./mojo-dllm inspect PATH.gguf | head -40
```

You get the metadata, a count of tensor types, and every tensor with its
shape. The binary's own commands (`inspect`, `tokenize`, `logits`) go to
`build/mojo-dllm` unchanged, after the same rebuild check. Any other word stops
with the closest command name.

## Without the launcher

The launcher is a convenience. The binary works on its own:

```bash
uv sync --frozen
scripts/build.sh
build/mojo-dllm run --model PATH.gguf --prompt "Hello" --device cpu
```

`build/mojo-dllm` defaults to `--device cpu` and takes only file paths.
