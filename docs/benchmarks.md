## What is compared

For LLaDA, all three runtimes load LLaDA-8B-Instruct Q4_K_M and denoise a
canvas of L = prompt + 128 tokens in 32 steps. For Dream, mojo-dllm and
llama.cpp (diffuse-cpp's Dream support needs its own converted file, not
benchmarked here) do the same with Dream-v0-Instruct-7B Q4_K_M; both run
Dream's timestep schedule over the whole canvas. A step is one full forward pass over the
canvas in each of them, so the step counts and shapes match.

| Runtime | How it runs | Schedule |
|---|---|---|
| mojo-dllm | `run --max-tokens 128 --steps 32 --block-length 32` | LLaDA blocks of 32, low-confidence |
| mojo-dllm (ablation) | the same plus `--full-logits` | logits for every position, as the other two compute them |
| llama.cpp | `llama-diffusion-cli -ub L --diffusion-steps 32 --diffusion-eps 0.001` | timestep schedule |
| diffuse-cpp | `diffuse-cli -n 128 -s 32 --no-cache --remasking low_confidence` | one block, cosine schedule |
| diffuse-cpp † | `diffuse-cli -n 128 -s 32 --remasking entropy_exit` | its recommended mode |

diffuse-cpp cannot read llama.cpp's GGUF files, so it loads its own
conversion of the same model (`diffuse-cpp/LLaDA-8B-Instruct-GGUF`,
`llada-8b-q4km.gguf`, 5.5 GB): F16 embeddings and a slightly different Q4_K /
Q6_K mix. It has no tokenizer and receives the token ids mojo-dllm produces.
It prints no timings either, so the harness timestamps the two lines it writes
around its generate call.

llama.cpp runs its timestep schedule because its block mode needs the prompt
length to be a multiple of the block size. The schedules commit tokens in a
different order, which changes the text but not, we expect, the cost of a step.
That is an argument. The measurement that does not depend on the schedule is the
"forward pass alone" table below, which times one pass at the same token count.

† diffuse-cpp's recommended mode reuses K/V between steps and stops early when
the canvas has settled. It does less work, so it is not a like-for-like row.

## On the GPU

`bench/config-gpu.json` and `bench/config-dream-gpu.json` compare
`mojo-dllm --device gpu` with the same `llama-diffusion-cli` built with CUDA
and run with `-ngl 99`; the harness refuses a CUDA run unless llama.cpp
reports every layer on the GPU. Canvas, steps and prompts match the CPU runs.
These configs leave the pytest watchdog off (`"kill_pytest": false`), so each
result records how busy the CPU was before every run. Peak RSS is host memory;
neither runtime reports GPU memory. The GPU tables above come from these
configs.

The test GPU is a laptop part held to 30 W, whose clocks fall under
sustained load (`bench/checks/2026-10-12-gpu-power-under-load.txt` and
`bench/checks/2026-11-03-gpu-power-limit.txt`) and vary from day to day: the
same llama.cpp build ran LLaDA steps much slower on 2026-10-12 than on
2026-10-09 (compare `bench/results/archive/2026-10-09-gpu-llada.json` with
`bench/results/archive/2026-10-12-gpu-llada.json`). The 2026-11-03 file
records three builds run back to back at about 1.1 GHz and 30 W: absolute
milliseconds follow the clock, and ratios inside one file do not.
Both runtimes in one result file run interleaved, prompt by prompt, so
compare them within a file, not across dates.

`bench/config-fair-cpu.json` and `bench/config-fair-gpu.json` address two
questions about fairness: whether llama.cpp does better below 12 threads on a
hybrid CPU (a sweep over `-t 4, 6, 8, 12`), and how the forward passes compare
without either runtime's sampler (mojo-dllm's measured forward pass against
llama.cpp's `llama-bench` at the same token count).

## Method

`bench/run_bench.py` does the measuring:

- three prompts and, by default, three repetitions (the fairness configs use
  one prompt, and the CPU thread sweep ran two repetitions), runtimes
  interleaved within each repetition;
- every run waits until a two-second sample shows the CPU under 10% busy, and
  starts anyway after 300 seconds (60 in the fairness configs); the busy
  fraction before each run is recorded as `cpu_busy_before`, and the tables
  disclose runs that started above the threshold;
- the power profile is `performance` for the duration and restored after;
- on battery, where a laptop caps CPU and GPU power, it pauses before the
  next run until the charger is back, and a run the charger left midway is
  thrown away and repeated (`bench/power.py`; each run records
  `power_waited_s`, `power_retries`, `on_battery`, `power_source` and a snapshot
  of the supplies it read, and `--allow-battery` measures on battery instead).
  The check fails closed: a supply file it cannot read stops the run, and a
  battery with the adapter offline counts as battery whatever its status says;
- a watchdog kills any `pytest` process (other work on the machine started
  test suites mid-run), and the kills are logged in the result file;
- generation time excludes model loading, which is reported as startup;
- peak RSS comes from `/usr/bin/time`.

The table above is generated from `bench/results/*.json` by
`scripts/bench_table.py`, and CI fails if a table differs from the evidence file
it names. Two gaps are open: `--check` passes when a table marker is missing, a
target file is missing, or the quality or eval evidence is deleted ([#141](https://github.com/vladimirrott/mojo-dllm/issues/141)), and an
unknown mode exits 0 ([#142](https://github.com/vladimirrott/mojo-dllm/issues/142)).

## Steps and quality

A diffusion model commits `tokens / steps` tokens per step. The table above
uses 4 tokens per step, which is fast and shows in the text as repeated or
dropped words. More steps cost proportionally more time, so the headline
tokens / s above is not a quality-matched figure. In the first prompt below,
the repeated words disappear at 64 steps, which takes about twice the time of
32 steps, so by that count mojo-dllm's quality-matched speed on that prompt is
about half the headline rate. Other runtimes use other schedules. The code prompt shows no such damage at 32 steps.

Evidence: `bench/quality/2026-10-03-LLaDA-8B-Instruct.Q4_K_M.json` (mojo-dllm `bdd268b`).
<!-- quality:end -->

"Repeated words" counts immediate repetitions such as "the the", a rough
proxy for parallel-decoding damage. `bench/quality.py` records the runs and
`scripts/bench_table.py` renders this table.

### Accuracy of `--threshold` and `--dual-cache`

Both options change what a step computes, so their answers can differ from
the plain sampler's. A paired GSM8K run checks how often they still get the
answer right (`bench/eval_gsm8k.py`, see [Development](development.md)):

<!-- eval:start -->
**LLaDA-8B-Instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf**, GSM8K, 200 problems, flags `--max-tokens 256 --block-length 32 --steps 256 --device gpu --json`, mojo-dllm `3b2dac4`.

| Arm | accuracy | vs baseline | 95% CI | discordant | McNemar p | passes / problem | time / problem |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| baseline | 80.5% | | | | | 237.0 | 79.7 s |
| dualcache | 81.5% | +1.0 pt | -4.4 to +6.4 pt | 14 / 16 | 0.86 | 236.6 | 15.8 s |
| threshold09 | 80.0% | -0.5 pt | -2.2 to +1.2 pt | 2 / 1 | 1.00 | 73.4 | 24.1 s |

Discordant counts problems only the baseline solved / only the arm solved. Time per problem is the mean over the first 50 problems of each arm, a round that ran with nothing else on the machine.

Evidence: `bench/eval/2026-10-29-baseline-vs-dualcache.json`, `bench/eval/2026-10-29-baseline-vs-threshold09.json`, `bench/eval/2026-10-29-baseline-vs-dualcache-first50.json`, `bench/eval/2026-10-29-baseline-vs-threshold09-first50.json`.

## Limits of this evidence

- One machine: a 13th Gen Intel i5-13420H laptop for the CPU tables, with an
  RTX 3050 6 GB laptop GPU for the GPU tables. Another CPU, memory speed or
  GPU can change the ratios.
- The four main tables use the median of 3 runs on each of 3 prompts (9 runs);
  the forward-pass tables use 2 or 3 runs on one prompt; the quality table is a
  single run per cell. Each table has one model file and one quantization
  (Q4_K_M).
- The schedules differ between runtimes (see above), so tokens / s compares
  runtimes at one step count, not at one output quality.
- Each table names its commit in a `Versions` or `Evidence` line, except the two
  forward-pass tables, whose commits are in their evidence files. They differ,
  because the evidence was recorded as the work went on; no single commit holds
  all of it, and the release tag is not one of them.
- The quality column counts immediate repeated words on two prompts. It is not
  a perplexity or a task score. The only task evidence is the GSM8K run for
  `--threshold` and `--dual-cache` on LLaDA.
- diffuse-cpp loads its own conversion of the model, so its rows are indicative.
- No binary is published yet ([#105](https://github.com/vladimirrott/mojo-dllm/issues/105)): you build from source.

## Reading the numbers

- **ms / step** is the cost of one denoising pass over the canvas.
- **tokens / s** is 128 divided by generation time. A diffusion model's
  tokens/s depends on the step count you choose, so compare ms / step first.
- The ablation row shows what computing logits only for candidate positions
  saves.
- On the GPU, read ms / step, the step-time ratio line under each GPU table
  and peak RSS together. The ratio pairs the two runtimes run by run, and one
  GPU with one quantization (Q4_K_M) stands behind it. mojo-dllm also holds
  far less in host memory, because it uploads the weights once and releases
  the file's pages behind it.
- The thread sweep and the forward-pass-alone tables test the CPU comparison.
  If llama.cpp ran faster below 12 threads, or mojo-dllm's lead came only from
  skipping logits, those tables would show it. The sweep stops at 12 because
  the test CPU runs 12 threads.
- A note under a table counts the runs that started on a busy CPU and gives
  the medians over the quiet runs alone.
