# Security policy

mojo-dllm reads GGUF files, which are untrusted input the moment you download
one. The parser bounds-checks every read against the file size and refuses
unknown tensor types, implausible counts and tensors that run past the end of
the file. A crash or out-of-bounds read on a malformed file is a security bug.
