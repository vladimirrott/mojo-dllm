# lock CPU-only users out. So the target is always named: the local GPU's
# compute capability when nvidia-smi reports one, sm_80 otherwise (the oldest
# architecture the int8 tensor-core kernels support). MOJO_DLLM_GPU_ARCH
# overrides both. The chosen architecture and the reason go to stderr; an
# nvidia-smi that is installed but fails is called out as a warning.
